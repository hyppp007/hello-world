## OOSE Team Member Evaluation

Instructions: Fill out a section below for each member of your group. These evaluations will be kept 100% confidential.  There will be an entry in Gradescope to submit your evaluations.  Gradescope unfortunately wants pdf submissiont, but you can convert .md to .pdf in many ways, e.g.

 * use http://www.markdowntopdf.com.
 * install pandoc (see https://pandoc.org/installing.html) and type ```pandoc eval-individual.md -o evals.pdf```
